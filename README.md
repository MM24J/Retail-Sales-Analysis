Retail_Analysis Project

  Our project is about investigating datasets that pertain to retail businesses and what we could uncover from the data to provide businesses with valuable insight on sales productivity. We were confronted with many factors a retail business would come across that influence their sales. To attain the goal of our project, we used the ETL process to help us unravel the data and once the data was cleaned we constructed our ERD to help map out our data. Finally, we created table schemas to be loaded into our PostgreSQL database to allow potential businesses to examine the data with ease.

  To interact and use our project database, we can begin by downloading our Features_tables.csv and Stores_Data_table.csv from our resource folder and saving that locally. Then with our retaildb.sql file we can use that table schema to create the database tables within PostgreSQL. From there the user has the freedom to create any queries to find the desired data that provides answers to any questions that the user may have.

  While working on the project we did our due diligence to ensure we were complying with all ethical concerns when working with our dataset. First, we started by examining our dataset for any personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure we avoided breaching any individualâ€™s privacy. Additionally, to make sure we are allowed to use the dataset for the purpose of our project. We researched the data source and found that the author of the dataset has attached a CC0: Public Domain license providing us fair use of the dataset.
